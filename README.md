Detailed Battery Monitor

A custom-built KDE Plasma 6 widget designed to provide detailed, real-time battery statistics and more accurate time estimates than the default system monitor.

This plasmoid goes beyond basic percentage and remaining time by fetching advanced metrics directly from UPower.
It utilizes data smoothing and averaging to provide more stable and reliable time remaining estimates.

It falls back to calculating time based on energy remaining and a weighted average power history to smooth out rapid fluctuations in CPU load.

Custom battery design capacity is configurable if your battery doesn't report it.
